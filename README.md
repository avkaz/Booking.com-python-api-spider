# Booking.com API Scraper

## Overview

The Booking.com API Scraper is a tool designed to quickly retrieve data from Booking.com using the hidden API. This approach enables fast data extraction without the need for proxy servers, streamlining the scraping process.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Utilizes Booking.com's hidden API for rapid extraction of hotel information.
  
- **No Proxy Requirement:** Unlike traditional web scraping, this method bypasses the need for proxy servers, reducing costs and complexity.
  
- **Comprehensive Hotel Overview:** Gathers essential details such as hotel names, star ratings, distance from the center, and the lowest available price.
  
- **Data Trend Analysis:** Ideal for regular scraping to track price trends, making it a valuable tool for market analysis.

## Limitations

- **Overview Pages Only:** The API provides access to overview pages, limiting detailed information to what's available on the hotel list.
  
- **Machine Learning Potential:** While current functionality is focused on overview data, the collected information serves as a foundation for potential machine learning applications in the future.

## Use Cases

- **Daily Price Tracking:** Daily scraping allows tracking price changes over time, enabling users to identify trends and make informed decisions.
  
- **Data for Machine Learning:** The extracted data provides a rich dataset for potential machine learning projects related to hotel pricing and market analysis.

## Sibling Scraper

This scraper has a sibling built with the Scrapy framework, allowing for more detailed information retrieval by crawling individual hotel pages. However, please note that this method is more resource-intensive as it requires the usage of proxies due to Booking.com's bot detectors.
